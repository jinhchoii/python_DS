#  Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial
# 
#### What is data structure?
#### Data structure is a system to manage, organize, and store the data in an effieicnt way. 
[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,be%20applied%20to%20the%20data.)
#
#### Why do we need to learn data structure? 
It is a important tool for programmers to anayze the cost of the algorithm. Every good programmer should learn about it!

#### Runtime Basics - The performance of the data structure

1. What is Bog O notation 
How efficient is an algorithm or a pice of code? 
Big O notation is a methematiccal method of specifying the performance of an algorithm to answer that question. It predicts the execution time as the size of the problem grows. 

- The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function
- The letter n represents the input size
- The O() represents the complexity of the algorithm regarding the input size

2. The performance 

|Performance |Run Time|Description|
|-----|----|----|
|O(1) | constant  |..| 
|O(log(n)) | log  |..|
|O(n) | linear  |..|
|O(n^2) | quadratic  |..|
|O(2^n) | exponential  |..|
